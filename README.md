🔐 First App – Login & Register with Authentication

Assignment | 2nd Year, 1st Semester

First App is a simple login and registration system developed using the React framework as part of an assignment during our 2nd Year, 1st Semester. The project includes basic authentication functionality, allowing users to register, log in, and access protected content.

This assignment helped us understand key concepts such as React components, state management, form handling, and implementing authentication logic. It was a foundational project in learning how to build secure and interactive front-end applications.
